# About the dataset
The **PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System)** dataset, developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, provides high-resolution data and tools for analyzing solar energy potential globally. This dataset offers information on solar radiation, photovoltaic (PV) system performance, and climatic variables, enabling users to assess the feasibility and efficiency of solar energy projects.
Key features of the PVGIS dataset include:
- **Solar Radiation Data:** Historical and real-time data on global, direct, and diffuse solar radiation.
- **PV Performance Simulation:** Detailed estimations of energy production from different PV technologies.
- **Geographical Coverage:** Global data with high spatial and temporal resolution.
- **Customizable Tools:** Interactive tools for site-specific assessments, including shading analysis and energy production predictions.
- **Data Formats:** Downloadable data in various formats for research and analysis.
  
This dataset supports renewable energy planning, research, and implementation by providing reliable, location-specific solar energy insights.
